Spring-ONVIF
--------------------

Implement ONVIF Services using :
- Spring Framework
- Apache CXF for WS endpoints
- Apache Camel to route request to dedicated SOAP processor
- Groovy to process SOAP request and fill SOAP answer

Container is a war, but should be possible as jar and osgi.

Try to not use any java code, only spring DSL !
